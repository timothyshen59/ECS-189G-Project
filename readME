The project trains Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) for semi-supervised node classification. 

How to Run GCN 
1) Navigate to Method_GCN.py file in PyCharm
    - location: local_code/stage_5_code/Method_GCN.py
2) Right click on the file and click "Run 'Method_GCN'"
    - This will call classes and functions within local_code/stage_5_code/ to train and evaluate the model

Outputs
    - Average Test Accuracy across 50 runs 
    - For each epoch, output Accuracy, F1-Score, Precision, Recall, Loss
    (Optional)
    You can uncomment the commented block of code to run the model once only and you'll get
    - Plots on Training Loss Curve over epochs for most recent runs
    - Saved under result/stage_5_result as a png


The stage_5_data/ will NOT be included in the repository due to GitHub's 100 MB file size limit
However, these files can be found in the class Google Drive and downloaded. Make sure to store them under data/stage_5_data
